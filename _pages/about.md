My name is Lola Le Breton. I am a PhD candidate working at Mila - Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Prof. Sarath Chandar.

Before Montr√©al, I graduated from the engineering cursus (M.Sc.) of Ecole Polytechnique (France, Palaiseau) with a focus on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy hiking, theatre and music.
