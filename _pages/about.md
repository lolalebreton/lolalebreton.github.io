My name is Lola Le Breton. I am a graduate research student working at Mila - Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Prof. Sarath Chandar and studying at Polytechnique Montréal.

Before Montréal, I graduated from the engineering cursus (M.Sc.) of Polytechnique France with a focus on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy hiking, theatre and music.
