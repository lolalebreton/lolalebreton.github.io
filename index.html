	Currently

<font size="4">
	I am a graduate research student working at Mila - Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Prof. Sarath Chandar.
	In parallel, I am following graduate courses in Machine Learning at Polytechnique Montréal and UDEM. My main interests are Deep Learning, Optimization and Lifelong Learning.

	Before Montréal
</h3>

<font size="4">
	I graduated from the engineering cursus (M.Sc.) of <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polytechnique France</a> with a focus on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
	For a year, I also had the chance to further my coding skills at <a href="https://42.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">school 42</a>.

<h3>
	About me
</h3>

<font size="4">
	I grew up in French Polynesia, a small group of islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I later spent most of my studies in Paris. Outside of the lab, I really enjoy learning about science in general, hiking in Canada's beautiful nature and going to the theatre.
